# Usage
1. Launch cpp program
2. Launch Python program to get graphs. You will need matplotlib for this

# Example

# Explanation

First graph shows all execution times in microseconds. 

**cmath pow** - pow function from cmath

**Binary power** - binary power algorithm

**Precalc** - there is a table created before calculation. It doesn't calculate anything just gets value from table

**Hardcode** - instead of pow it uses several multiplies (a ^ 3 == a * a * a)
